# Quiz
This project is a simple demonstration of how to build a quiz game in for iOS in Objective-C restoring the previous session even if the app is closed. This way the user can't spend more than "maximum time" to make the Quiz, and can't response again the same question.

Note, debug build allows to restart the Quiz.
